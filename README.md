# Ember Sparks

> Design isn't about how it looks, it's about how it works.

Ember Sparks aims to create a new set of default UI components that can be used in all Ember apps. 

By using the power of ember-css-modules and the Ember ecosystem's emphasis on conventions, Ember is in a unique position to be a fantastic platform for component creators. 

With the addition of Ember Sparks, addon authors can effortlessly share UI elements that have sane defaults, but are also incredibly easy to customize.

------

## Install

```bash
ember install ember-sparks
```

Restart your app after the installation and you're ready to go!


## Usage

Ember Sparks comes with some handy preinstalled components, such as `{{input-spark}}` and `{{toggle-spark}}`.

You can use them simply by dropping them into your template:

```handlebars
{{input-spark
	placeholder="your-username"
	prefix="ludu.co/@"
}}
```

Check out the official website's "Components" part to see a list of all the built-in Sparks.
